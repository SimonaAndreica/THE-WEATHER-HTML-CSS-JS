Weather-app-using-html-css-and-javascript

This is a simple weather app using HTML, CSS and JS. API key is required for this weather app to work.
I used this key from the official OpenWeatherMap website for free. After I registered using the email, the API key (APPID) was sent in a confirmation email.
